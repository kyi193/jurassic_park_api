# Jurassic Park API by Kevin Yi

# How to start server:
Run in console:
```
bin/rails server
```
Things to improve on/need:
  1. Enumerate certain values such as Active and Down cage statuses
  2. Add more specific validation errors when dealing with invalid API inputs
  3. Testing (rspec)
  
 How I tested:
  1. Use forms on the browser to add/edit/delete dinosaurs and cages
  2. Use external browser like Postman to make API requests
